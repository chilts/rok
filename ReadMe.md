# Rok #

Rok is a simple store that can be inherited from, to aid storing, updating, and listening to changes in your models.

## Why ##

There are so many other stores out there, so why not?

Rok has models for:

* text (Rok.Text)
* boolean (Rok.Bool)
* object (Rob.Obj)
* enum (Rob.Enum)

More docs to come on each of these.
